## About the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS)


### Getting Started with NCCS Data

[Beginners Guide to NCCS Data](https://nccs.urban.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/Guide%20to%20Using%20NCCS%20Data.pdf)

[NCCS Data: R Users Guide](https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nccs-data-r-users-guide#nccs-data-r-users-guide)

**3 Types of Files** 

* IRS Business Master Files (BMF)  
* NCCS Core Files (Core)  
* IRS Statistics of Income Exempt Organizations Sample Files (SOI)  

### IRS Business Master Files (BMF)

**Updated**

* BMF datasets are generally released multiple times per year; at least one per year is available going back to 1995
* Files are updated by the IRS on a regular basis, and downloaded to the NCCS Data Archive several times per year
* The information in the BMF is almost always the most up to date information about these organizations and their filing statuses.

**Contains**

* Each file represents the number of organizations registered with the IRS during the month/year indicated
* The BMF contains records both for active and inactive organizations, as well as registered organizations operating below the minimum
requirements for filing a Form 990 or 990-EZ. 

**Does Not Contain**

* The number of total fields from the Form 990 are very limite
* Financial fields are limited solely to total revenue and total assets
* Many Parts of the Form 990 are not represented at all 

### NCCS Core Files

[Data Dictionary](https://nccs-data.urban.org/showDD.php?ds=core)

**Updated**

* Released once per year, the NCCS Core Files represent the entire population of active, reporting organizations of the given type filing within a given circa year

**Contains**

* Thus, each Core File contains multiple fiscal yearsâ€™ worth of information, but only one record for each EIN.
* This data is aggregated to show an accurate snapshot of actual
nonprofit activity within the given year, accounting for the varying filing patterns and fiscal years of different nonprofits.
* The NCCS Core Files contain a far wider selection of financial fields from the Form 990 than the BMF, including detailed information on revenue, expenses, and assets. 
* Further, the Core files are subject to the NCCS validation procedure before release, making the data more accurate than that
contained in the BMF.

#     type: type of data, given as follows (include quotes)
#           "pc" = 501(c)(3) public charities
#           "pf" = 501(c)(3) private foundations
